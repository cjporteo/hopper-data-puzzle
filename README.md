# 🐇 Hopper Data Puzzle ✈

My solution and thought process for the Hopper data puzzle.

## 💭 About

This puzzle is posted on several data-related job postings for Hopper. There is essentially no prompt or problem statement to go with this puzzle, we're simply given a list of 1024 2-dimensional datapoints (with no column names to give us any clues).

## 🧐 Solution

Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/cjporteo/hopper-data-puzzle/blob/main/puzzle.ipynb)!

TL;DR: The columns correspond to longitude and latitude (with a scalar transformation) and the points represent airport locations worldwide.

In the notebook, you can see how I developed this solution and computed the linear functions.
